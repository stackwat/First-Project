# Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create an interactive terminal-based "Guess the Number" game using Python. The program should randomly generate a number based on the chosen difficulty level, allow the player a limited number of attempts to guess it, and provide feedback after each attempt. The project aims to reinforce basic Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input handling, and random number generation.

# Scope of the Project

This project focuses on building a simple, self-contained command-line game that:

* Runs entirely in the terminal without requiring additional libraries.
* Includes multiple difficulty levels, each with defined number ranges and attempts.
* Provides clear instructions and user feedback during gameplay.
* Utilizes structured Python functions to handle different levels and game flow.

The project does not include GUI elements, scoring systems, user profiles, or multiplayer features. The goal is to keep the experience lightweight and beginner-friendly.

# Target Users

* Students learning Python programming.
* Beginners experimenting with interactive command-line projects.
* Educators who want simple examples to demonstrate Python basics.
* Anyone interested in a quick, casual guessing game.

# High-Level Features

* **Three Difficulty Levels:** Each level offers a unique range of numbers and a fixed number of attempts.
* **Random Number Generation:** Each game session selects a random target number for the player to guess.
* **Interactive Gameplay:** The player receives prompts, feedback, and end-of-level summaries.
* **Replayable Menu System:** Users can choose levels repeatedly or exit the game at any time.
* **Clear Feedback:** The game informs the user whether their guess is correct or incorrect after each attempt.
